****************ft_ls****************
**IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LS COMMAND.**
*************************************


I. Get and parse the arguments.

	1. Check for options:
		a. Options must be set before the directories (if there's any specified):
			<ft_ls [-aBcD -Oxr] [directory]>
		   So there maybe multiple arguments containing options, but they must be the first one after
		   the command itself.
		b. Store all the options into a table.
	
	2. The other arguments should be the directories to list.

II. List the content of the directories.
	
	1. Is there any directories specified in the call to the program?
	IF NOT:
		a. Use "." (current working directory) as the directory to list.
	IF YES:
		a. Send them one by one to the actual listing part of the program.
		b. Also send the options so the listing is done accordingly.
		c. Check for the validity of the directories / pathes while opening them..
		d. Actually display their content, recursively if -R is set.
	2. Exit program.
