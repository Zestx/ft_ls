 SORTING
 - Choose the best most suited sorting algorithms and implement them:
 	- alphabetical sorting, uppercase first (default).
	- last modification time sorting (-t)
	- reverse the sorting, can be used in combination with -t.  (-r)
 ERROR MANAGEMENT
 - Check if all error cases are managed properly and nothing is neglected.
 - In case of error:
 	- Display an informative error message.
	- Make sure every allocated memory is freed properly.
	- Leave the program safe and clean.
 RECURSION
 - Implement the recursive listing (-R).
