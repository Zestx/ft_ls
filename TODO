 SORTING
 - Choose the most suited sorting algorithms and implement them:
 	- alphabetical sorting, uppercase first (default).
	- last modification time sorting (-t)
	- reverse the sorting, can be used in combination with -t.  (-r)
 ERROR MANAGEMENT
 - Implement all tests and error checks.
 - In case of error:
 	- Display an informative error message.
	- Make sure every allocated memory is freed properly.
	- Leave the program safe and clean.
 
 BUGS:
 - Weird segfault (systematic).
